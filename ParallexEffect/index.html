                Safety should always be a priority for anyone who rides a bike, whether they are a novice or experienced. Riders should always dress appropriately, which means wearing a properly fitting helmet to protect their head and clothing that allows them to be seen clearly during both the day and evening. Items worn while riding a bicycle should be brightly colored with reflective details. Bicycles should be checked before every ride to ensure that the tires are properly inflated and the brakes are in good working condition.

                The holy city of Puri located by the Bay of Bengal is one of the four main Hindu pilgrimage sites in India (besides Badrinath, Dwarka and Rameswaram) and is famous for the 12th-century Jagannath Temple. The subtle fragrance of incense mixes with the salty coastal breeze and the sound of prayers from countless temples reverberate through the air here. With an aura of mysticism and bliss, Puri has always been a magnet for pilgrims. However, over the last five years, it has become a melting pot for surfers and travellers who are searching for isolation and a wild coastal surf experience, thanks to the yearly India Surf Festival held here. The beautiful beaches of Puri offer some of the best waves for surfing in India.
